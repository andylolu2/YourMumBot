Bot: Your mum is such a shit game

User: Today is a good day. You are very tall.

```

## How it works

YourMumBot makes use of 3 main NLP models / tools:
1. [Stanford CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) 
via [stanza](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/corenlp_client.html)
2. [Detoxify](https://github.com/unitaryai/detoxify)
3. [Language tools](https://github.com/jxmorris12/language_tool_python)

### Pipeline

1. The `CoreNLP` library 
[constituency parser](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/parse.html)
is used to 
identify noun phrases (NP) in an input sentence. 
2. These NPs serves as potential places in the sentence where we can
substitute the NP with the string `your mum`. This works surprisingly 
well.
3. For each of these potential substitutions, we use `Detoxify` to 
rate the toxicity of the sentence. We then pick the sentence 
that has the highest toxicity.
4. At various points while processing the input, `language tools` 
is used to correct grammatical mistakes of the (potential) 
output sentences. 

    For example, this might be due to substitution of 
    `you` with `your mum` in `You are very tall`, which leads 
    to the grammatically incorrect output `your mum are very tall`.

    `language tools` tries to fix this problem.

## Discord Bot

### No of requests

YourMumBot is currently hosted on a small droplet on Digital Ocean. 
YourMumBot will only process at most 1 requests at the same time. Any other requests will be ignored.

### Input size

YourMumBot only processes user inputs that are 
shorter than 150 characters and shorter than 
25 words. This is to ensure quick processing for 
low latency and prevent a single request to 
hog to server.

### Latency

Latency is usually around 500-1000 ms.

## API

### Endpoint

There is an api endpoint available at [http://46.101.67.210/yourmumify](http://46.101.67.210/docs).

- `422`: Request body is not valid:
  - `msg` can only contain ascii characters.
  - `msg` length must be less than or equal to `150` characters.
  - `msg` must contain than or equal to `25` words.

### Memory requirements

1Â GB of RAM is barely sufficient to run all related services for this model.
Swap file is needed to prevent Out-Of-Memory errors.
